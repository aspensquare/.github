### When an Issue Is Required
If the change affects user behavior, data models, system behavior, or UI, open an issue first.
The issue provides WHAT and WHY.

### When an Issue Is Not Required
Refactoring, configuration, documentation, and test-only changes may be opened directly as PRs.
Use the "Maintenance" PR template for these.
